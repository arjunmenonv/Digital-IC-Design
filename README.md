# Digital-IC-Design
Schematic and Layout libraries of digital logic gates and cells. Assignments and Projects of EE5311 at IIT Madras. 

Collaborators: [Arjun Menon V](https://github.com/arjunmenonv), [Srinivas R]() and [Ashwanth S]()


To run simulations for the schematic and layout files included in the library, replace the include path with path to the model file in the .include command.

Tools used:
- [Electric VLSI](https://www.staticfreesoft.com/productsFree.html): for schematic and layout generation
- [Java 3D](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/java-archive-downloads-java-client-downloads.html#java3d-1.5.1-oth-JPR): for layout visualisation in 3D
- [LTSpice](https://www.analog.com/en/design-center/design-tools-and-calculators/ltspice-simulator.html): SPICE simulation
